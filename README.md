# web-scraping-challenge
for week 12 homework


The purpose of this project was to scrape information about mars from the internet, and store that data in a mondgo db.

I updated the data days after starting the project so some headlines have changed.  I used pandas, beautiful soup, splinter, and pymongo for this project.
